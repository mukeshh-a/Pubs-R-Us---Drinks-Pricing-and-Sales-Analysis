# Pubs-R-Us---Drinks-Pricing-and-Sales-Analysis

Hey everyone! I am thrilled to share my experience working on the Drinks Pricing and Sales Analysis challenge for Pubs "R" Us. \
As a Pricing Analyst, I had the opportunity to dive deep into our pub chain's data and gain valuable insights into our drinks pricing and sales performance.

## Database Schema

In this project, I worked with the following tables:

pubs: Contains information about our pubs, including pub_id, pub_name, city, state, and country.

beverages: Stores details about our beverages, such as beverage_id, beverage_name, category, alcohol_content, and price_per_unit.

sales: Tracks the sales transactions, including sale_id, pub_id, beverage_id, quantity, and transaction_date.

ratings: Stores customer ratings and reviews, with rating_id, pub_id, customer_name, rating, and review.

## Questions Explored

I answered various important questions using SQL queries:

1. How many pubs are located in each country?
2. What is the total sales amount for each pub, including the beverage price and quantity sold?
3. Which pub has the highest average rating?
4. What are the top 5 beverages by sales quantity across all pubs?
5. How many sales transactions occurred on each date?
6. Find the name of someone that had cocktails and which pub they had it in.
7. What is the average price per unit for each category of beverages, excluding the category 'Spirit'?
8. Which pubs have a rating higher than the average rating of all pubs?
9. What is the running total of sales amount for each pub, ordered by the transaction date?
10. For each country, what is the average price per unit of beverages in each category, and what is the overall average price per unit of beverages across all categories?
11. For each pub, what is the percentage contribution of each category of beverages to the total sales amount, and what is the pub's overall sales amount?
